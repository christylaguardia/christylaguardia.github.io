# Why'd You Leave?

*I was totally a legit Pioneer and I have the business cards to prove it*

I've been asked many times "Why did you leave your religion?" from both ex-JWs and non-ex-JWs. My default answer has usually been something related to the false doctrine I uncovered or the controlling nature of religion or the scandalous lies told by the leaders, etc., etc., etc.

Ok, sure, I can "prove by references" the faulty teachings and lies of Jehovah's Witnesses. But although all of that is true and without a doubt legitimate reasons for leaving, **the fact that _I wasn't happy_ should've been enough**.

It took me past year since I've been out of the cult to realize that my feelings are valid and superior to those of any religion I am apart of, person I know or organization that I belong to. I don't need to justify the decision I made to anyone, because I know I make the right choice for me.

Looking back, I see that some of why I didn't leave sooner was because I wanted to compile concrete evidence-based reasons for leaving. Of course, I am glad that I did all of that research, but because I felt such a strong need to do so, shows how little value I put on my own feelings of happiness and well being. So in order for me to muster up the courage to change my life, I felt that I had to look outward for validation, when the whole time I had the most compelling reason to leave within me. I just didn't know how to listen to my internal voice telling me to get out! (And that's how I know I was brainwashed.)
