Hi! I'm a Full Stack JavaScript developer located in Portland, Oregon.
Trained in software engineering, my professional background includes mechanical engineering, HVAC-R drafting and products, and lots of SQL development and data managment.
When I'm not coding I'm usually hitting the trails with my beagle, Charlie, making pottery or eating ice cream.
            

I'm a builder who loves solving problems.

I happen to do that writing JavaScript code as a Full-Stack Developer.

I like taking complex challenges and coming up with simple solutions to them.
